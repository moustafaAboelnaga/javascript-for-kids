## Creating Popups and Variables

#### Create different types of popups

Create a popup with some text

```javascript
alert("hello");
```

Give users some information

```javascript
alert("you win!");
```

```javascript
alert("you lose!");
```

Add some numbers together and show the result

```javascript
alert(2 + 2);
```

Add some words together

```javascript
alert("hello " + "everyone!");
```

#### Saving a value as a variable

Save the sentence as a variable and display its value
```javascript
var hello = "hello world";
alert(hello);
```

####Display a popup that asks for an answer
```javascript
prompt("Enter a secret word");
```

Display the popup again and save the answer as a variable
```javascript
var answer = prompt("Guess a letter");
alert(answer);
```
